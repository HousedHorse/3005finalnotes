# Definitions

## Database Terms
- **Database**
  - a collection of related data stored on a computer
- **Data**
  - a value which represents known facts with an implicit meaning
- **Mini world**
  - some part of the real world which is represented by the data stored in the database
- **Database management system** (DBMS)
  - software to facilitate creation and maintenance of a database
- **Database system**
  - database and...
  - the application programs developed on top of the DBMS

## Actors
### Behind the Scenes
- **System designer**
  - design and implement DBMS modules
- **Tool developer**

- **End user**
  - use DB day-to-day
  - don't know or care how DB is structured
  - two categories:
    - na&iuml;ve users
    - business analysts

## Data Models
- **Data model**
  - way of representing data in a meaningful way
  - how data is *structured* and *operated*
  - three parts:
    - concepts to describe structure
    - operations for manipulating structures
    - constraints which must be obeyed
  - **entity relationship model**
    - entities connected by relationships
  - **hierarchical model**
    - tree-like structure
    - group by records and links
    - navigational and procedural operations
  - **network model**
    - network structure
    - grouped by records and links
    - navigational and procedural operations
  - **relational model**
    - tables
    - tuples in relations
    - declarative operations
- **Constructs**
  - a data model concept which defines the structure of the DB
  - elements and their types
  - groups of elements
  - relationships between such groups
- **Operations**
  - basic model operations
    - `insert`
    - `delete`
    - `update`
    - `query`
  - user-defined operations
    - `compute_gpa`
    - `update_inventory`
- **Constraints**
  - specify restrictions on the data
- **Physical data model**
  - low level
  - describe how data is stored physically
- **Conceptual data model**
  - high level
  - how the user will perceive data
  - how the user will access/modify data
- **Implementation data model**
  - somewhere between physical and conceptual
  - the sum of those two parts
- **Self-describing data model**
  - description of the data is combined with its values
- **Database schema**
  - description of data at some abstraction level
  - just the relations and attribute names
  - also called **intension**
- **Database instance**
  - a snapshot of the data at a given point in time
  - relations, attribute names, tuples
  - also called **extension**

## Database Languages
- **DDL** (data definition language)
  - add or remove data
- **DML** (data manipulation language)
  - change data
- **QL** (query language)
  - query data

## Relational Database Definitions
- **Schema of a relation**
  - denoted by $R(A_1,A_2,...,A_n)$
  - $R$ is the **name**
  - $A_1,A_2,...,A_n$ are the **attributes**
- **Tuple**
  - ordered set of values
  - written : $<V_1,V_2,...,V_n>$
    - each value $V_n$ is derived from an appropriate domain
  - an $n$-$tuple$ is a tuple with $n$ values
- **Domain**
  - three parts:
    - name
    - data type
    - set of **atomic** values (indivisible values)
- **Attribute**
  - attribute name designates a role played by a domain in a relation
  - can be the same as a domain name
    - e.g., a user-defined type `Name` which is the domain of an attribute also called `Name`
- **Cartestian product**
  - let $D_1,D_2,...,D_n$ be a set of $n$ domains
  - cartesian product on $D_1,D_2,...,D_n$ is
    - $\{<d_1,d_2> \mid{} d_1$ in $D_1,$ $d_2$ in $D_2\}$

# Intro

## Types of Database
- We are only concerned with **traditional applications**
- Business Data Processing (Numeric and Textual)

## DBMS Functionality
- **Load** initial database contents on a secondary storage medium
- **Define** a database in terms of:
  - data types
  - data structures
  - constraints
- **Manipulate** the database
  - retrieve
    - query
    - generate reports
  - modify
    - insert
    - delete
    - update
  - access
    - through web applications which provide a graphical front end
- **Handle concurrency** from multiple users
- **Security measures** to restrict unauthorized access
- **Presentation and visualization** of data
- **Maintenance** of database and application programs

## Application/Database Interaction
- **Queries**
  - access data according to specifications and return a result
- **Transactions**
  - read data and update
  - store new data
- **No unauthorized access**
- Keep up with changing user requirements

## Characteristics of the Database Approach
- **Self-Describing**
  - **catalog** stores descriptions of a database
    - data structures
    - data types
    - constraints
  - the description is called **meta-data**
  - allows the DBMS to work with many different applications
- **Insulation**
  - we can change the way the data is structured and organized without changing the application programs
- **Abstraction**
  - a **data model** is used to hide details
    - presents users with a *conceptual view* of the database
    - programmers refer to model constructs and not the nitty-gritty details
- **Multiple views**
  - each user can see a different view 
  - **only see the data they care about**
- **Sharing data and multi-user transactions**
  - allow **concurrent** retrieval and modification of database
  - *concurrency control* guarantees either:
    - correct execution of a transaction OR
    - abortion of a transaction
  - *recovery* subsystem ensures each transaction's effect is correctly recorded
  - **OLTP** (online transaction processing) allows hundreds of concurrent transactions per second

## Types of Database User

- DB administrators
  - acquire software and hardware resources
  - control the use of those resources
  - monitor efficiency
  - monitor use of DB
  - authorize access to DB
- DB designers
  - define the following aspects of a DB:
    - structure
    - constraints
    - content
    - transactions
  - must understand end users' needs
- System analysts
  - design applications and canned transactions for a DB

  - don't know or care how DB is structured
  - two categories:
    - na&iuml;ve users
    - business analysts

# Database System Concepts and Architecture
## Data Representation
- We need to *abstract* the representation to make it meaningful

### Hierarchical Model
- Tree-like structure
  - records
  - links
- Navigational and procedural operations

![The hierarchical data model from Mengchi's slides.](img/hierarchical.png){height=33%}

### Network Model
- Network structure
  - records
  - links
- Navigational and procedural operations

![The network data model from Mengchi's slides.](img/network.png){height=33%}

### Relational Model
- Tuples and relations
- Declarative operations specify what to get instead of how to get it

## Schemas
- Description of the data at some abstraction level
- Three levels, each with its own schema:
  - internal (physical)
    - how the data is stored, physically
    - physical storage structures
    - access paths
  - conceptual
    - structure and constraints for the whole database
    - high-level or implementation data model
  - external
    - user views
    - typically same data model as conceptual schema
- Physical data independence
  - change internal schema without changing the conceptual schema
- Logical data independence
  - change conceptual schema without changing external schema
- See \autoref{icepl} for a trick here (ICE PL)

![**ICE PL**, my trick for remembering schema types and which independence is which.\label{icepl}](img/icepl.png)

- Two important physical models
  - centralized
    - can still remote in but all processing is done centrally
  - client/server

## Database Languages
- DDL (data definition language)
  - `insert`
  - `delete`
- DML (data manipulation language)
  - `update`
- QL (query language)
  - `get`
- SQL
  - combines all three

# Relational Databases
## Concepts
- Relation name
- Attributes (schema)
  - column headers
- Tuples (instance)
  - rows of entries in the table
- Domain
  - the set of all possible values of an attribute
